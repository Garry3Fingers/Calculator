# Calculator

For this project I need to have some basic math operations:

1. Add
2. Subtract
3. multiply
4. divide 

Input will be via buttons on the web page and keyboard. 

Functions: 

1. User can input floating point numbers
2. A 'backspace' button for for undo the wrong number
3. Clear button
4. Display an error message when the user tries to divide by 0 


Steps:

- Functions for all of the basic math operators.
- Function 'operate' that takes an operator and 2 numbers.
- A basic HTML calculator with buttons for each digit, each of the above math operators and an “Equals” key.
- Functions that populate the display when user clicks the number buttons.

Note:

- The calculator should not evaluate more than a single pair of numbers at a time.
- Output should round answers with long decimals so that they don’t overflow the screen.
- Pressing “clear” should wipe out any existing data.
- Users should be able to string together several operations and get the right answer, with each pair of numbers being evaluated at a time.
